# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-neuralNetworks
In this project, I aimed to recognize handwritten numbers by training a neural network model.

The MNIST dataset is a dataset that is already in libraries. After training the model with MNIST, I measured the accuracy of the model on the test data and then examined how this model made predictions on the images I created.

I wrote 28x28 pixel handwritten numbers in the images with paint.

The model processes the images, guesses which number it is and visualizes the results.
